# CS:GO Analysis of Matches

## An introduction analysis to potential changes over tracking/data collection for CS:GO matches

This project is intended to explore some potential explorations for CS:GO matches (demo parsing). Such as:
* Utility score;
* Radar chart for contribution;
* Total Flash Assits and friendly flashbangs;
* Killed in X position by Y position mapping (this still needs some work);

## Setup
To install, simply do the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

You should be able then to run the *Analyzing CS_GO Data.ipynb* notebook which contains all the analysis and code for these.

## Final Considerations
Despite not being the best place to store this kind of information - I also have updated matches data here as I have no place to put them atm.

If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue or drop me a message =)
